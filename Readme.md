## [Importing a LibGDX project](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/gettingstarted/Importing%20into%20IDE.html#intellij)
Importing projects into your IDE should be painless if setup correctly.
**It is highly recommended that you use the Intellij IDE.**

 ### [Import Project in Intellij 

-   File > Open > ProjectRoot/build.gradle
-   Uncheck 'Create separate module per source set'
-   Select OK on the 'Import Project from Gradle dialog'

-   Import all modules
 **If you have any issues when importing, resolve these before continuing!**
>Once the project has imported you should run a Gradle sync in the IDE to make sure everything is OK. To do this you bring up the Gradle tool window (View > Tool windows > Gradle), and hit the sync button, which is in the top left of the Gradle tool window.
If this succeeds, you are all imported and ready to get developing.
